# DATA 622 - Machine Learning and Big Data

Collection of DATA 622 assignments

This course provides a foundational understanding of machine learning techniques, covering both supervised and unsupervised methods, including regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Students will gain hands-on experience with algorithms such as decision trees, Naive Bayes, support vector machines, and neural networks, as well as deep learning and transfer learning. The course also explores model evaluation, regularization, and the bias-variance tradeoff, with a focus on AI ethics, bias, fairness, and responsible deployment. By the end, students will be prepared to apply machine learning to real-world problems and assess their societal implications.
